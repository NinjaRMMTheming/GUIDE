				This is a guide on how to setup your browser (chrome or firefox based) to change the theme of the NinjaRMM Dashboard.	
			</p>
			<ul class="steps">
			  <li>
						<span><span class="innumber">1. </span><a class="chromewebstore" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/stylus?hl=en-US">Click Here</a> to go to chrome webstore and download an extension called STYLUS </span></li>
					<li><span><span class="innumber">2. </span>Once installed, head over to the NinjaRMM dashboard and go over to the extensions portion of the browser and look for the stylus icon</span><img src="assets/StylusIcon.png" width="25" height="25" alt=""/> and then click on it.</li>
					<li><span><span class="innumber">3. </span>From there, you will see a drop down and an option that says "Write style for" and you must click the section of the link BEFORE the .ninjarmm.com (ex. <span class="predom">app</span>.ninjarmm.com, you must click the word <span class="predom">app</span> on the link. This is due to other website being integrated into ninjarmm.com and we only want to effect the dashboard of ninja. If you dont understand what I mean or click elsewhere, I will show you how to verify or fix it.</span></li>
					<li><span><span class="innumber">4. </span> At this point, you should now be in the stylus dashboard and what we need to do at this point is verify the correct url is added and type at the bottom. The highlight blue section can be whatever name for the theme you want and the highlight red part is what we are more concerned with. The dropdown should say "URLs on the domain" and the link should have whatever your ninjadashboard url is. whatever.ninjarrmm.com. Once this is verified or fixed, click into the code section and hit space or put <br>
						<br>
						<span class="firstinputrt">:root {<br>
							}<br></span>
						and then click save on the top left.</span></li>
					<img class="stylusdashimg" src="assets/stylusdashboard.png" width="800" height="600" alt=""/>
				<li><span><span class="innumber">5. </span>Now we can add themes to make it come to life.</li>
